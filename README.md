    <h1>Data Structures Implemented in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>This repository contains various data structure implementations written in JavaScript. These data structures are essential building blocks for solving a wide range of algorithmic problems and are fundamental for understanding computer science concepts.</p>

    <h2>Implemented Data Structures</h2>

    <h3>1. Stack</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Stack</strong> is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, referred to as the "top" of the stack.</p>
    <p><strong>Operations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>push()</code>: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li><code>pop()</code>: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Queue</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Queue</strong> is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the end (rear) and removed from the front.</p>
    <p><strong>Operations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>enqueue()</code>: Adds an element to the end of the queue.</li>
        <li><code>dequeue()</code>: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Binary Search Tree (BST)</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> is a node-based data structure where each node has at most two children. It maintains the order property where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node’s value, and the right subtree only nodes with values greater than the node’s value.</p>
    <p><strong>Operations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>insert()</code>: Adds a value to its correct position in the tree.</li>
        <li><code>find()</code>: Searches for a value in the tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Singly Linked List</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Singly Linked List</strong> is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Operations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>push()</code>: Adds a node to the end of the list.</li>
        <li><code>pop()</code>: Removes the last node from the list.</li>
        <li><code>shift()</code>: Removes the first node from the list.</li>
        <li><code>unshift()</code>: Adds a node to the start of the list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Doubly Linked List</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Doubly Linked List</strong> is similar to a Singly Linked List, but each node has two links: one to the next node and one to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.</p>
    <p><strong>Operations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>push()</code>: Adds a node to the end of the list.</li>
        <li><code>pop()</code>: Removes the last node from the list.</li>
        <li><code>shift()</code>: Removes the first node from the list.</li>
        <li><code>unshift()</code>: Adds a node to the start of the list.</li>
    </ul>
